## Pre-work

Please do the requested Git/GitHub prep in advance! Go [here](https://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html#pre-workshop-set-up) for details. If you have questions, please ask me.
Please use your github account to set up an RStudio Cloud account as well. We will use RStudio cloud for hand-on exercises during the workshop. It is a nice way to prevent us from spending hours on fixing bugs due to missing packages etc.

## Overview
This is a 1.5-day hands on workshop designed for beginner and experiences R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle. You'll learn holistic workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis. We'll work on project-oriented workflows, version control for data science (Git/GitHub!), and how to plan for collaboration, communication, and iteration (incl. RMarkdown).

In terms of your R skills, expect to come away with new knowledge of your R installation, how to maintain it, robust strategies for working with the file system, debugging tools, and ways to use the purrr package for repetitive tasks.

## Mission

During the workshop we will visit the different building blocks from which reproducable research reports like [this](https://lisallreiber.github.io/GeneAnalysis/p1_0101_describe_plots.html) are made of. If everything goes well, everyone will succeed in producing a website with visualization ov meta infomation via their own Github account.


## Is this course for me?

-   Have you been using R for a while and feel there might be better ways to organize your R life, but don't know what they are?
-   Do you want to streamline your workflow for doing analysis and automating repetitive tasks in R?
-   Are you willing to get into the weeds of your R installation, project organization, error messages, and source code?

You should take this workshop if:

-   You've been using R for a while and you feel like writing R code is not what's holding you back the most.
-   You've realized that you have more pressing "meta" problems that no one seems to talk about.
-   You want to know how to divide your work into projects and scripts, how to expose your work to others, and how to get more connected to the R development scene.

The tidyverse is not an explicit focus of the course (other than the purrr segment) and you can certainly work through the content without it. But you should expect a great deal of tidyverse exposure.

-   Visualizing and Sharing Meta Data
-   Take control of your R installation: startup, libraries & packages
-   Why and how re: version control, esp. with R and RStudio

## Feedback and communication

<https://gather.town/app/RL6StuU0Rtlvtqp9/R-workshop> is our virtual meeting room at Gather.town. We will use the workshop area for all-group input sessions and the group-table areas for working in small groups. Don't worry if you are not familiar with Gather.town yet, we will explore it a together at the beginning of the workshop.

[Issues](https://github.com/lisallreiber/R-Workshop/issues) \<-- all are encouraged to open issues as we go. This is actually tremendously helpful to me! Examples of issue-worthy thoughts:

-   Glitches in the instructions or materials that I need to fix, for current workshop or future
-   Missing content that I point to
-   Great questions or sidebar discussions that I should consider formalizing and recording
-   Questions that are too specific or technical to answer in real-time
