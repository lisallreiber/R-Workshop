# Welcome to Hands-on Meta Viz: How to code in R Markdown

## Here are some things you and your group can try out
1. Open a new R Markdown file and save it under 03_Analysis in this folder
2. Check out the Help < Keyboard Shortcuts Help to find the one that lets you insert a new code chunk
3. Insert a couple of chunks and let them output different things (calculations, tables, plots)
4. Chunk Options: What happens if you set the `echo` argument in the set-up chunk (first chunk in the document) to FALSE and knit the document?
5. Chunk Options II: What happens when you change the(\`r inline code\`)
7. Plot Options: What happens when you change the fig.width in the chunk options where one of your plots is produced?

**Bonus:**  
- Include an image with knitr::include_graphics()  
- Try out to display your results in-line or in the viewer (go to the options next to the wheel for that)

---

**Bonus II:**  
- Did you know you can export plots directly from the viewer? Try it  
- load the package esquisse (`library(esquisse)`) and explore our or your own dataset with it (via addins)
