# Congratulations, you make your way to this folder :)

# This is a normal R-Script, you can write comments by starting the line with a #
# but you can also run code, try it out:

2 + 2

# with the here package, you can specify paths within your project
# for example: lets load all the packages that are listed in the 00_packages.R script in the main folder of the project

source(here::here("00_packages.R"))


# Your turn:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#' 1. Identify Sections from the video:
  #' Environment,
  #' Source Editor
  #' Console
  #' Help
  #' Package management
  #' Git


# 2. if you want to know which packages you just loaded, go check out the file in the main folder (you can find it in the "files" section of RStudio)

# 3. Create a new R-Script and save it in the 01_RStudio folder.

# Bonus: can you find the option that turns on the rainbow parenthesis?
